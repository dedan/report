title = {Variability and correlated noise in the discharge of neurons in motor and parietal areas of the primate cortex},
abstract = {We analyzed the magnitude and interneuronal correlation of the variability in the activity of single neurons that were recorded simultaneously using a multielectrode array in the primary motor cortex and parietal areas 2/5 in rhesus monkeys. The animals were trained to move their arms in one of eight directions as instructed by a visual target. The relationship between variability (SD) and mean of the discharge rate was described by a power function with a similar exponent ( approximately 0.57), regardless of the cortical area or the behavioral condition. We examined whether the deviation from mean activity between target onset and the end of the movement was correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with variability in activity during the hold period before target onset. In both cortical areas, for about a quarter of the neurons, the neuronal noise of these two periods was positively correlated, whereas significant negative correlations were seldom observed. Overall, neurons with higher signal correlation (i.e., similar directional pattern) showed higher noise correlation in both cortical areas. On the other hand, when the data were divided according to the distance between the electrode tips from which the neurons were recorded, a consistent relationship between the signal and noise correlations was found only for pairs of neurons recorded through the same electrode. These results suggest that nearby neurons with similar directional tuning carry primarily redundant messages, whereas neurons in separate cortical columns perform more independent processing.},

title = {Properties of primary motor cortex output to forelimb muscles in rhesus macaques},
abstract = {Stimulus-triggered averaging (StTA) of electromyographic (EMG) activity from 24 simultaneously recorded forelimb muscles was used to investigate properties of primary motor cortex (M1) output in the macaque monkey. Two monkeys were trained to perform a reach-to-grasp task requiring multijoint coordination of the forelimb. EMG activity was recorded from 24 forelimb muscles including 5 shoulder, 7 elbow, 5 wrist, 5 digit, and 2 intrinsic hand muscles. Microstimulation (15 microA at 15 Hz) was delivered throughout the movement task. From 297 stimulation sites in M1, a total of 2,079 poststimulus effects (PStE) were obtained including 1,398 poststimulus facilitation (PStF) effects and 681 poststimulus suppression (PStS) effects. Of the PStF effects, 60% were in distal and 40% in proximal muscles; 43% were of extensors and 47% flexors. For PStS, the corresponding numbers were 55 and 45% and 36 and 55%, respectively. M1 output effects showed extensive cofacilitation of proximal and distal muscles (96 sites, 42%) including 47 sites that facilitated at least one shoulder, elbow, and distal muscle, 45 sites that facilitated an elbow muscle and a distal muscle, and 22 sites that facilitated at least one muscle at all joints. The muscle synergies represented by outputs from these sites may serve an important role in the production of coordinated, multijoint movements. M1 output effects showed many similarities with red nucleus output although red nucleus effects were generally weaker and showed a strong bias toward facilitation of extensor muscles and a greater tendency to facilitate synergies involving muscles at noncontiguous joints.},

title = {A novel algorithm to remove electrical cross-talk between surface EMG recordings and its application to the measurement of short-term synchronisation in humans},
abstract = {Pairs of discharges of single motor units recorded in the same or different muscles often show synchronisation above chance levels. If large numbers of units are synchronous within and between muscles then the synchrony will be measurable in population recordings such as surface EMG. Measuring synchrony between surface EMG recordings has a number of practical and scientific advantages compared with single motor units recorded from intramuscular electrodes. However, the measurement of such synchrony in the time domain between surface EMGs is complicated because the recordings are contaminated by electrical cross-talk. In this study we recorded surface EMG simultaneously from five hand and forearm muscles during a precision grip task. Using a novel 'blind signal separation' algorithm, we were able to remove electrical cross-talk. The cross-talk-corrected EMGs could then be used to assess task-dependent modulation in both oscillatory (15-30 Hz) and non-oscillatory synchrony (all other frequencies). In agreement with previous studies, the oscillatory component was maximal during steady holding but abolished during movement. By contrast, the non-oscillatory component of the EMG synchrony appeared remarkably constant throughout all phases of the task. We conclude that surface EMG recordings can be of considerable use in the assessment of population synchrony changes, providing that electrical cross-talk between nearby channels is removed using a statistical signal processing technique. Our results show a striking difference in the task-dependent modulation of oscillatory and non-oscillatory synchrony between muscles during a dynamic precision grip task.},

title = {On the relations between the direction of two-dimensional arm movements and cell discharge in primate motor cortex},
abstract = {The activity of single cells in the motor cortex was recorded while monkeys made arm movements in eight directions (at 45 degrees intervals) in a two-dimensional apparatus. These movements started from the same point and were of the same amplitude. The activity of 606 cells related to proximal arm movements was examined in the task; 323 of the 606 cells were active in that task and were studied in detail. The frequency of discharge of 241 of the 323 cells (74.6%) varied in an orderly fashion with the direction of movement. Discharge was most intense with movements in a preferred direction and was reduced gradually when movements were made in directions farther and farther away from the preferred one. This resulted in a bell-shaped directional tuning curve. These relations were observed for cell discharge during the reaction time, the movement time, and the period that preceded the earliest changes in the electromyographic activity (approximately 80 msec before movement onset). In about 75% of the 241 directionally tuned cells, the frequency of discharge, D, was a sinusoidal function of the direction of movement, theta: D = b0 + b1 sin theta + b2cos theta, or, in terms of the preferred direction, theta 0: D = b0 + c1cos (theta - theta0), where b0, b1, b2, and c1 are regression coefficients. Preferred directions differed for different cells so that the tuning curves partially overlapped. The orderly variation of cell discharge with the direction of movement and the fact that cells related to only one of the eight directions of movement tested were rarely observed indicate that movements in a particular direction are not subserved by motor cortical cells uniquely related to that movement. It is suggested, instead, that a movement trajectory in a desired direction might be generated by the cooperation of cells with overlapping tuning curves. The nature of this hypothetical population code for movement direction remains to be elucidated.},

title = {Emergence of simple-cell receptive field properties by learning a sparse code for natural images},
abstract = {The receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented and bandpass (selective to structure at different spatial scales), comparable to the basis functions of wavelet transforms. One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},

title = {Stability of output effects from motor cortex to forelimb muscles in primates},
abstract = {Stimulus-triggered averaging (StTA) of electromyographic (EMG) activity is a form of intracortical microstimulation that enables documentation in awake animals of the sign, magnitude, latency, and distribution of output effects from cortical and brainstem areas to motoneurons of different muscles. In this study, we show that the properties of effects in StTAs are stable and mostly independent of task conditions. StTAs of EMG activity from 24 forelimb muscles were collected from two male rhesus monkeys while they performed three tasks: (1) an isometric step tracking wrist task, (2) an isometric whole-arm push-pull task, and (3) a reach-to-grasp task. Layer V sites in primary motor cortex were identified and microstimuli were applied (15 muA) at a low rate (15 Hz). Our results show that the sign of effects (facilitation or suppression) in StTAs of EMG activity are remarkably stable in the presence of joint angle position changes (96% stable), whole-arm posture changes (97% stable), and across fundamentally different types of tasks such as arm push-pull versus reach-to-grasp (81% stable). Furthermore, comparing effects across different phases of a task also yielded remarkable stability (range, 84-96%). At different shoulder, elbow, and wrist angles, the magnitudes of effects in individual muscles were highly correlated. Our results demonstrate that M1 output effects obtained with StTA of EMG activity are highly stable across widely varying joint angles and motor tasks. This study further validates the use of StTA for mapping and other studies of cortical motor output.},

title = {Coordinate transformation is first completed downstream of primary motor cortex},
abstract = {It was suggested previously that the transformation of action to muscle-based coding is completed in the primary motor cortex (M1). This is consistent with a predominant direct pathway leading from M1 to motoneurons. Accordingly, spinal segmental interneurons that are located downstream to M1 are expected to show muscle-like coding properties. We addressed this hypothesis using simultaneous recording of cortical and spinal activity in primates performing an isometric wrist task with multiple targets and two hand postures. Here we show that while the motor cortex follows an intermediate coordinate frame, spinal interneurons already follow a muscle-like coordinate frame. We thus suggest that the final steps in coordinate transformation of motor commands take place downstream of M1 via corticospinal interactions.},

title = {Firing properties of spinal interneurons during voluntary movement. I. State-dependent regularity of firing},
abstract = {The firing properties of single spinal interneurons (INs) were studied in five awake, behaving monkeys performing isometric or auxotonic flexion-extension torques at the wrist. INs tended to fire tonically at rest (mean rate, 14 spikes (sp)/sec) and during generation of static torque (mean rate, 19 sp/sec in flexion, 24 sp/sec in extension). INs exhibited regular firing, with autocorrelation functions showing clear periodic features and a mean coefficient of variation of interspike intervals (CV) of 0.55 during production of static torque. For the population, there was an inverse correlation between CV and mean rate. However, 46% of the INs had task-dependent changes in regularity that were not predicted by changes in firing rate, suggesting that their firing pattern is determined not only by the intrinsic properties of the neurons but also by the properties of its synaptic inputs. INs showed two main response types to passive wrist displacement: biphasic and coactivation. Cells with these sensory responses had different, stereotypical temporal activity profiles and firing regularity during active movement. However, INs having correlational linkages with forearm muscles, identified as features in spike-triggered averages of electromyographic activity, did not exhibit unique responses or firing properties, although they tended to fire more regularly than other INs. This suggests the lack of a precise mapping of inputs to outputs for the spinal premotor network.},
