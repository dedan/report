title = {Coordinate transformation is first completed downstream of primary motor cortex},
abstract = {It was suggested previously that the transformation of action to muscle-based coding is completed in the primary motor cortex (M1). This is consistent with a predominant direct pathway leading from M1 to motoneurons. Accordingly, spinal segmental interneurons that are located downstream to M1 are expected to show muscle-like coding properties. We addressed this hypothesis using simultaneous recording of cortical and spinal activity in primates performing an isometric wrist task with multiple targets and two hand postures. Here we show that while the motor cortex follows an intermediate coordinate frame, spinal interneurons already follow a muscle-like coordinate frame. We thus suggest that the final steps in coordinate transformation of motor commands take place downstream of M1 via corticospinal interactions.},

title = {Firing properties of spinal interneurons during voluntary movement. I. State-dependent regularity of firing},
abstract = {The firing properties of single spinal interneurons (INs) were studied in five awake, behaving monkeys performing isometric or auxotonic flexion-extension torques at the wrist. INs tended to fire tonically at rest (mean rate, 14 spikes (sp)/sec) and during generation of static torque (mean rate, 19 sp/sec in flexion, 24 sp/sec in extension). INs exhibited regular firing, with autocorrelation functions showing clear periodic features and a mean coefficient of variation of interspike intervals (CV) of 0.55 during production of static torque. For the population, there was an inverse correlation between CV and mean rate. However, 46% of the INs had task-dependent changes in regularity that were not predicted by changes in firing rate, suggesting that their firing pattern is determined not only by the intrinsic properties of the neurons but also by the properties of its synaptic inputs. INs showed two main response types to passive wrist displacement: biphasic and coactivation. Cells with these sensory responses had different, stereotypical temporal activity profiles and firing regularity during active movement. However, INs having correlational linkages with forearm muscles, identified as features in spike-triggered averages of electromyographic activity, did not exhibit unique responses or firing properties, although they tended to fire more regularly than other INs. This suggests the lack of a precise mapping of inputs to outputs for the spinal premotor network.},

journal = {J Neurosci},
title = {On the relations between the direction of two-dimensional arm movements and cell discharge in primate motor cortex},
abstract = {The activity of single cells in the motor cortex was recorded while monkeys made arm movements in eight directions (at 45 degrees intervals) in a two-dimensional apparatus. These movements started from the same point and were of the same amplitude. The activity of 606 cells related to proximal arm movements was examined in the task; 323 of the 606 cells were active in that task and were studied in detail. The frequency of discharge of 241 of the 323 cells (74.6%) varied in an orderly fashion with the direction of movement. Discharge was most intense with movements in a preferred direction and was reduced gradually when movements were made in directions farther and farther away from the preferred one. This resulted in a bell-shaped directional tuning curve. These relations were observed for cell discharge during the reaction time, the movement time, and the period that preceded the earliest changes in the electromyographic activity (approximately 80 msec before movement onset). In about 75% of the 241 directionally tuned cells, the frequency of discharge, D, was a sinusoidal function of the direction of movement, theta: D = b0 + b1 sin theta + b2cos theta, or, in terms of the preferred direction, theta 0: D = b0 + c1cos (theta - theta0), where b0, b1, b2, and c1 are regression coefficients. Preferred directions differed for different cells so that the tuning curves partially overlapped. The orderly variation of cell discharge with the direction of movement and the fact that cells related to only one of the eight directions of movement tested were rarely observed indicate that movements in a particular direction are not subserved by motor cortical cells uniquely related to that movement. It is suggested, instead, that a movement trajectory in a desired direction might be generated by the cooperation of cells with overlapping tuning curves. The nature of this hypothetical population code for movement direction remains to be elucidated.},

title = {Variability and correlated noise in the discharge of neurons in motor and parietal areas of the primate cortex},
abstract = {We analyzed the magnitude and interneuronal correlation of the variability in the activity of single neurons that were recorded simultaneously using a multielectrode array in the primary motor cortex and parietal areas 2/5 in rhesus monkeys. The animals were trained to move their arms in one of eight directions as instructed by a visual target. The relationship between variability (SD) and mean of the discharge rate was described by a power function with a similar exponent ( approximately 0.57), regardless of the cortical area or the behavioral condition. We examined whether the deviation from mean activity between target onset and the end of the movement was correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with variability in activity during the hold period before target onset. In both cortical areas, for about a quarter of the neurons, the neuronal noise of these two periods was positively correlated, whereas significant negative correlations were seldom observed. Overall, neurons with higher signal correlation (i.e., similar directional pattern) showed higher noise correlation in both cortical areas. On the other hand, when the data were divided according to the distance between the electrode tips from which the neurons were recorded, a consistent relationship between the signal and noise correlations was found only for pairs of neurons recorded through the same electrode. These results suggest that nearby neurons with similar directional tuning carry primarily redundant messages, whereas neurons in separate cortical columns perform more independent processing.},

title = {Properties of primary motor cortex output to forelimb muscles in rhesus macaques},
abstract = {Stimulus-triggered averaging (StTA) of electromyographic (EMG) activity from 24 simultaneously recorded forelimb muscles was used to investigate properties of primary motor cortex (M1) output in the macaque monkey. Two monkeys were trained to perform a reach-to-grasp task requiring multijoint coordination of the forelimb. EMG activity was recorded from 24 forelimb muscles including 5 shoulder, 7 elbow, 5 wrist, 5 digit, and 2 intrinsic hand muscles. Microstimulation (15 microA at 15 Hz) was delivered throughout the movement task. From 297 stimulation sites in M1, a total of 2,079 poststimulus effects (PStE) were obtained including 1,398 poststimulus facilitation (PStF) effects and 681 poststimulus suppression (PStS) effects. Of the PStF effects, 60% were in distal and 40% in proximal muscles; 43% were of extensors and 47% flexors. For PStS, the corresponding numbers were 55 and 45% and 36 and 55%, respectively. M1 output effects showed extensive cofacilitation of proximal and distal muscles (96 sites, 42%) including 47 sites that facilitated at least one shoulder, elbow, and distal muscle, 45 sites that facilitated an elbow muscle and a distal muscle, and 22 sites that facilitated at least one muscle at all joints. The muscle synergies represented by outputs from these sites may serve an important role in the production of coordinated, multijoint movements. M1 output effects showed many similarities with red nucleus output although red nucleus effects were generally weaker and showed a strong bias toward facilitation of extensor muscles and a greater tendency to facilitate synergies involving muscles at noncontiguous joints.},

abstract = {The classical view of neural coding has emphasized the importance of information carried by the rate at which neurons discharge action potentials. More recent proposals that information may be carried by precise spike timing have been challenged by the assumption that these neurons operate in a noisy fashion--presumably reflecting fluctuations in synaptic input and, thus, incapable of transmitting signals with millisecond fidelity. Here we show that precisely synchronized action potentials can propagate within a model of cortical network activity that recapitulates many of the features of biological systems. An attractor, yielding a stable spiking precision in the (sub)millisecond range, governs the dynamics of synchronization. Our results indicate that a combinatorial neural code, based on rapid associations of groups of neurons co-ordinating their activity at the single spike level, is possible within a cortical-like network.},

title = {Autocorrelation analysis reveals widespread spatial biases in microarray experiments},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA microarrays provide the ability to interrogate multiple genes in a single experiment and have revolutionized genomic research. However, the microarray technology suffers from various forms of biases and relatively low reproducibility. A particular source of false data has been described, in which non-random placement of gene probes on the microarray surface is associated with spurious correlations between genes. RESULTS: In order to assess the prevalence of this effect and better understand its origins, we applied an autocorrelation analysis of the relationship between chromosomal position and expression level to a database of over 2000 individual yeast microarray experiments. We show that at least 60% of these experiments exhibit spurious chromosomal position-dependent gene correlations, which nonetheless appear in a stochastic manner within each experimental dataset. Using computer simulations, we show that large spatial biases caused in the microarray hybridization step and independently of printing procedures can exclusively account for the observed spurious correlations, in contrast to previous suggestions. Our data suggest that such biases may generate more than 15% false data per experiment. Importantly, spatial biases are expected to occur regardless of microarray design and over a wide range of microarray platforms, organisms and experimental procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial biases comprise a major source of noise in microarray studies; revision of routine experimental practices and normalizations to account for these biases may significantly and comprehensively improve the quality of new as well as existing DNA microarray data.},

abstract = {Visuomotor transformation is a fundamental process in executing voluntary actions. The final steps of this transformation are presumed to take place in the corticospinal (CS) system, yet the way in which the motor cortex (MC) interacts with spinal circuitry during this process is unclear. We studied neural correlates of visuomotor transformation in the MC and cervical spinal cord while monkeys performed an isometric wrist task. We recorded 2 measures of population activity: local field potential (LFP), reflecting local synaptic inputs and multi-unit activity (MUA), reflecting spiking activity emitted by nearby neurons. We found robust cortical and spinal responses locked to visual and motor events. In motor cortex, LFP responses were predominantly visually related; MUA responses were mostly motor related. Spinal LFP responses were generally weak, yet spinal MUAs showed visual and motor responses with distinctive patterns. For both structures, amplitudes of visual responses were positively correlated with amplitudes of motor responses and negatively correlated with reaction times. The temporal relations of cortical and spinal responses shifted from weak coactivation before movement to increased coupling following torque onset, with cortical leading spinal activity. Thus, ongoing CS interactions may exist at early stages of movement preparation. These interactions are dynamic and may shape the executed motor action.},

abstract = {The receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented and bandpass (selective to structure at different spatial scales), comparable to the basis functions of wavelet transforms. One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},

title = {Dimensional reduction in sensorimotor systems: a framework for understanding muscle coordination of posture},
abstract = {The simple act of standing up is an important and essential motor behavior that most humans and animals achieve with ease. Yet, maintaining standing balance involves complex sensorimotor transformations that must continually integrate a large array of sensory inputs and coordinate multiple motor outputs to muscles throughout the body. Multiple, redundant local sensory signals are integrated to form an estimate of a few global, task-level variables important to postural control, such as body center of mass (CoM) position and body orientation with respect to Earth-vertical. Evidence suggests that a limited set of muscle synergies, reflecting preferential sets of muscle activation patterns, are used to move task-variables such as CoM position in a predictable direction following postural perturbations. We propose a hierarchical feedback control system that allows the nervous system the simplicity of performing goal-directed computations in task-variable space, while maintaining the robustness afforded by redundant sensory and motor systems. We predict that modulation of postural actions occurs in task-variable space, and in the associated transformations between the low-dimensional task-space and high-dimensional sensor and muscle spaces. Development of neuromechanical models that reflect these neural transformations between low- and high-dimensional representations will reveal the organizational principles and constraints underlying sensorimotor transformations for balance control, and perhaps motor tasks in general. This framework and accompanying computational models could be used to formulate specific hypotheses about how specific sensory inputs and motor outputs are generated and altered following neural injury, sensory loss, or rehabilitation.},

title = {Comparative gene expression analysis by differential clustering approach: application to the Candida albicans transcription program},
abstract = {Differences in gene expression underlie many of the phenotypic variations between related organisms, yet approaches to characterize such differences on a genome-wide scale are not well developed. Here, we introduce the "differential clustering algorithm" for revealing conserved and diverged co-expression patterns. Our approach is applied at different levels of organization, ranging from pair-wise correlations within specific groups of functionally linked genes, to higher-order correlations between such groups. Using the differential clustering algorithm, we systematically compared the transcription program of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans with that of the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Many of the identified differences are related to the differential requirement for mitochondrial function in the two yeasts. Distinct regulation patterns of cell cycle genes and of amino acid metabolic genes were also revealed and, in some cases, could be linked to the differential appearance of cis-regulatory elements in the gene promoter regions. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for comparative gene expression analysis and a rich source of hypotheses for uncharacterized open reading frames and putative cis-regulatory elements in C. albicans.},
