\begin{abstract}
A common approach to studying motor control is defining motor synergies which can explain observed motor actions. This approach assumes that the large repertoire of observed movements is achieved by co-activating a small number of motor primitives in a specific spatiotemporal pattern. While this approach was successfully applied to describe movements, the neuronal manifestation of this organization is yet to be demonstrated. In the experiment, two macaque monkeys were trained to perform a two dimensional isometric wrist task to eight peripheral targets at two hand postures. Muscle activity from 11 forearm muscles was recorded by electromyography (EMG) while the monkeys performed the task. In a subset of recording-sessions single-pulse microstimulation in related sites of the motor cortex was applied while measuring the evoked muscle response. 

The results of this experiment supports the thesis of a neuronal manifestation of the synergies. They suggest that the profile of muscle activation during the task could be well explained by two to three muscle synergies which were extracted by multivariate analysis (NMF algorithm). These synergies were robust across recording sessions and hand postures. In addition the muscle responses evoked by cortical stimulation proved to be structured and could be explained by three muscle synergies. It was furthermore found that the synergies extracted from evoked responses show similarities with the synergies from natural movement. \todo{topographic organization?}

In summary, the work will present new evidence which indicates that the motor cortical representation of muscles is similar to the organization of naturally occurring movements with respect to a small number of synergies.

\label{sg:sec:introduction}
%===============================================================================
% = about modular organization, dimensionality reduction and synergies in general =
%===============================================================================

The generation of adequate muscle activation patterns in order to achieve a certain goal is very complex. Difficulties arise from the high-dimensional and continuous sensory input space, from the dynamic and mostly non-linear transformations in between and the high-dimensional and continuous output space of the skeletomotor system. It was already shown in the famous study of Hubel and Wiesel~\cite{Hubel:1959p3833} that information in input space might be encoded by combinations of primitives, when neurons with receptive fields in forms of bars of several orientations were found. The newer theory of efficient coding argues similarly about the visual cortex and tries to find optimal sparse representations of sensory information which are governed by the statistical properties and regularities of the natural environment~\cite{Olshausen:1996p3611}.The formation of primitives governed by these regularities and modular organization might be able to simplify the difficulties that arise from the large number of degrees of freedom. Studies of the motor system, in particular of muscle activation patterns during movement, suggested the existence of fixed muscle activation patterns which form modular primitives in the output space to the skeletomotor system. 

By coupling of variables into a motor primitive (motor-\emph{synergy} in the following), the number of degrees of freedom can be dramatically reduced and therefore the modular organization into synergies might facilitate the generation of adequate muscle response patterns. Complex movement is then achieved by dynamic activation of linear combinations of these synergies.

Muscle synergies have been found in previous studies during natural movement and cutaneous stimulation of frogs~\cite{Tresch:1999p3783,Hart:2004p3786,Davella:2003p3784,Cheung:2005p3778}, cats~\cite{Ting:2004p3785} and humans~\cite{Merkle:1998p3780,Weiss:2004p3782,Krishnamoorthy:2003p3787,Olree:1995p3781,Ivanenko:2003p3779} by application of different methods of multivariate analysis. The activities during which synergies were found, range from postural responses to surface translation to completely unrestrained behavior in freely swimming and jumping frogs.

The research for this report is based on my BA-thesis and was done in a lab that studies the way motor command is translated into a detailed pattern of muscle activation within the corticospinal pathway. The working hypothesis of the lab is that the cortex does not control individual muscles; rather, it influences the activity of several functionally related groups of muscles. Furthermore, it is thought that detailed activation of muscles is generated by spinal neurons which integrate all the relevant dynamic parameters~\cite{yifat}.

Although modular organization into muscle synergies has been found in many cases, it is still not known what the underlying neural principles are. Following the working hypothesis of the lab, the neural correlate of synergies was assumed to be found in the motor cortex. Previous studies always investigated muscle synergies during natural movement. In the new approach of this study, muscle activation that was elicited by direct cortical stimulation was used for the search of muscle synergies.


\bigskip

The following questions will be addressed in this report:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Can an underlying modular structure of muscle activation patterns be found during natural movement?
	\item If so, what is the neural basis of these synergies? Does the stimulation of single or small groups of neurons in the motor cortex activate synergies?
	\item If both found, what are the properties of these synergies and what is the relation between them?
	\item Is there a topographic organization with respect to muscle synergies in the motor cortex?

\section{Animals, behavioral task and stimulation} % (fold)
\label{sg:sec:animals_and_behavioral_task}

The two monkeys (Maccaca fascicularis - subject id: C, V) used in the experiments performed an isometric wrist task with an instructed delay period where they held their hand in either a pronation or supination position and controlled a cursor on a computer screen. By applying a two-dimensional isometric torque at the wrist, they moved the cursor in the direction of one out of eight peripheral targets. A detailed description of the task can be found in a prior publication \cite{Yanai:2007p2455}.
% cortical chamber and mapping of the cortex
A cortical chamber was implanted above the motor cortex and the location of arm-related primary motor areas were mapped using a train of stimulating pulses (50 ms of biphasic stimulation given at 300 Hz with intensity $\leq$ 60 $\mu$A). This stimulation elicited an observable response (twitching of muscles) by which cortical areas could be related to forearm muscles. 

% EMG preprocessing
In both the behavioral task and stimulation condition, EMG activity was recorded simultaneously from forearm and hand muscles of the monkeys using sub-cutaneous intramuscular EMG electrodes (eleven muscles for V, sixteen for C). For naming of muscles see Appendix. \todo{ref to appendix}


The EMG signals were then amplified, bandpass filtered, sampled at 10 kHz and stored. Details of the EMG recording technique have been described previously \cite{Prut:2003p2780}. It was checked whether synchronous activations in the EMG signal might be induced by electrical cross-talk. This was done by a blind source separation algorithm\cite{Chan:1995p3040} according to the method of Kilner et al.\cite{Kilner:2002p2941}. The possibly induced correlations were found to be insignificant and therefore further processing in order to remove crosstalk was omitted. All data-analysis was performed by self-written software using the MATLAB platform\cite{code}.

\subsection{Muscle response patterns in the stimulation condition} % (fold)
\label{sg:sub:evoked_responses}

During a subset of the recording sessions, sites of the motor-cortex which are related to arm and hand movement were stimulated by low frequency (0.3 Hz) trains of single biphasic pulses (each phase lasted 0.2 ms) at different amplitudes (50-250 $\mu A$). The single-pulse stimulation was used to excite local and small groups of cortical neurons. Using multi-pulse stimulations could recruit distant neurons as well so that the mapping would not be clear without ambiguity. Although it was found that also single-pulse stimulation and even small currents might activate groups of neurons~\cite{Tehovnik:1996p3982}, this method can still be used to investigate the response patterns of motor-cortical neurons because the motor cortex shows topographic organization into a patch-like structure where neighboring neurons share similar response properties~\cite{Lee:1998p4164}

% normalization
For each channel, the stimulation times served as triggers for the averaging of the zero-meaned and rectified EMG signals to compute the average response window and from this the muscle response pattern for a stimulation site. Each response pattern is a vector of real numbers where each number corresponds to the change in activity of a certain muscle in a post-stimulus window. To get comparable results for different EMG channels, in spite of the fact that muscles have different background activation and variability they had to be normalized. A simple but reasonable and effective normalization technique is to define the response magnitude as change in mean activity in the post-stimulus window compared to mean activity in the pre-stimulus window. This method can deal with noisy channels without silencing them and is not affected by local DC offsets as only the change of activation is used as response magnitude. 

Although the DC component of the EMG signal was removed previous to average response window computation by subtracting the mean of the channel activity, some channels occasionally showed a still remaining DC component in the  window~\rref{sg:fig:images_dc_offset_fourier}. Analysis of raw data in the frequency domain showed that these channels with remaining DC offset contained large components in the frequency range between 10 and 500 Hz.
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/dc_offset_fourier.pdf}
	\caption{Channels 10, 6 and 2 which show components in the frequency domain between 10 and 500 Hz
	have a remaining offset in the average response window.}
	\label{sg:fig:images_dc_offset_fourier}
\end{figure}
These superimposed frequency components cause the remaining DC offset as they are not removed by a simple subtraction of the overall mean. They could be removed by application of a low-pass filter to the raw data; however, this measure was omitted as it did not influence the computation of muscle response patterns by the selected normalization technique. 

After visual inspection of the average response around stimulation, the activity in a window between 6 and 20 ms after stimulation was chosen for the computation of response patterns. These latencies are consistent with other experiments\cite{Park:2004p3042}. The introduction of a 6 ms offset after stimulation avoids the filtering of an always present artifact induced by the stimulation. This thin spike, strictly time-locked to 0, does not affect the window after 6 ms. Some sessions, in which single channels contained wider artifacts or which seemed to be corrupted by noise, were sorted out by hand after visual inspection~\rref{sg:fig:images_artifacts}.

\subsubsection{Response fields} % (fold)
\label{sg:subs:response_fields}

Response fields are defined as the size of the response elicited by cortical stimulation. The size was measured as the number of channels that showed a significant reaction to the stimulation. To identify the stimulus induced response for each channel separately, the average activity in a time window (-20 to -6 ms) prior to stimulus onset was compared with the average activity in a time window (6 to 20 ms) following stimulus onset. The comparison of these activations was performed across stimulus repetitions using a two-sided rank sum test (Wilcoxon rank sum test implementation of MATLAB 2008b). The muscle field size for each stimulation set was determined as the number of channels with significant responses (p < 0.05). Recordings from stimulation sites with a response field of size 0 have been discarded.

\label{sg:sub:natural_movement}
In order to ensure correctness and comparability of the responses, only correct trials were selected for this analysis. Correctness of the joystick movement into the direction of the goal was defined as trials in which reaction time was between -200 to 500 ms, movement time between 500 to 1500 ms and in which the angular deviation (at max velocity) was smaller than 35 deg. \todo{i changed this conditions, maybe add distribution plots}
To compute a response pattern of muscle activations during natural movement, the torque onset (force on the joystick exerted by the monkey) was used as the trigger for average window computation. In order to get comparable results between the channels, for further analysis the responses were defined, like the stimulation induced responses, as a relative change of activity. As pre-stimulus window, a time window of 500 ms before visual cue onset was chosen as it showed to give the best baseline estimate. Every trial of the recording session resulted in one response pattern. \todo{give number of average amount of trials or a plot of n\_trials distribution?}

\subsection{matrix factorizations in general} % (fold)
\label{sg:sub:mf}

As in previous studies mentioned above, whose goal was to search for muscle synergies, matrix factorization (MF) techniques were used to search for the possible underlying structure present in the data. This class of algorithms assumes that the data is a result of linear combinations of a few patterns which are distorted by noise. This can be modeled by the following equation,
\begin{equation}
	\vec{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n c_{i} \vec{w}_{i} + \vec{\varepsilon}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{x}$ is a N-dimensional data vector composed of the i-th basis vector $\vec{w}_{i}$, its scalar activation coefficient $c_{i}$ 
and $\vec{\varepsilon}$ is an unknown noise component vector.


Algorithms that assume a linear summation of muscle synergies attempt to recover the identity of the synergies using matrix factorization techniques that aim to explain the variability in muscle activity in different task conditions by variable activation of a smaller number of muscle synergies. The algorithms differ in the assumptions they make about the distribution of noise and activation coefficients of the data and consequentially yield different features. Two factorization algorithms were used in the study, whose constraints appeared to be biologically plausible and that were previously tested on synthetic and experimental data~\cite{Tresch:2006p3766}. They showed good performance on data sets having the special properties of muscle activations patterns (e.g. non-negativity, signal-dependent noise and possibly correlated activation coefficients) and were suggested to yield better results than other methods. Although the algorithms with best performance led to stable and reliable results, the two chosen factorizations where always applied in parallel to make sure that the result is not an artifact of the used MF-algorithm.
Additionally the \emph{explained variance} or \emph{remaining-error} of the model was always compared to random data exposing the same statistical properties, created by shuffling within the channels, to make sure that the results were not induced by statistical properties of the recorded data. This shuffling was repeated 100 times in order to get a better estimate of how much the remaining-error values were influenced by statistical characteristics instead of underlying structure. The remaining-error was defined as the distance between the original matrix and its approximation. 

The general form of the matrix factorization is: $A = W H$ where 

\begin{description}
	\item[A] is the activity matrix showing the change of mean EMG activity of each muscle (rows) for each task condition or stimulation site (columns). 
	\item[W] is a matrix with columns forming a base of muscle synergies. Each column is a single muscle synergy that shows the constant relations between different muscle activations when this specific synergy is activated.
	\item[H] is a loading matrix whose entries show the level of activation of a given synergy (row) in a given task condition or stimulation site (column). 	
\end{description}
  
Since the number of synergies are expected to be smaller than the number of muscles, the multiplication of matrices $W$ and $H$ only forms an approximation of $A$.
\begin{equation}
	A \approx W H \text{ with } A: m \times n, W: m \times l \text{ and } H: l \times n \text{  } | \text{  } l \leq m
\end{equation}
The reconstruction error between matrix $A$ and its approximation $W H$ decreases as the number of synergies (l) increases.

\subsection{Non negative matrix factorization (NMF)} % (fold)
\label{sg:sub:nmf}

The main advantage of NMF is the strong assumption of non-negativity \cite{Lee:1999p1635}, on both basis vectors and activation coefficients, which fits the muscle activation patterns. This assumption can be biologically interpreted as a constraint on the muscles such that each muscle may only be recruited to pull but not to push. Since components only add positive values, they cannot be combined to cancel each other. This property causes components to represent local features in the input space.

To solve the factorization problem the built-in NMF implementation of MATLAB 2008b (nnmf) was used. The NMF-algorithm tries to minimize the error function given by the square Euclidian distance between matrix $A$ and its approximation $WH$ and has been proven to converge to local minima of this function~\cite{Lee:2001p1638}. In order to search for a global minimum an exploration period was introduced. During this exploration phase 100 runs of the algorithm were repeated with different initializations. Within every run only 50 iterations were executed by using a more unstable multiplicative update rule, in order to enforce exploration. \todo{make sure that these numbers fit the value in the final computation I do}
The best result of the exploration was then used as the initialization for 100 additional iterations, which used the more stable and faster converging alternating update rule. The stability of this method was shown by repeating the whole procedure 20 times ultimately leading to 20 times l vectors with l being the number of assumed synergies (model order). This way the approximation of a $11 \times 100$ matrix to a linear combination of 3 (l) distinct 11 dimensional vectors led to $3 \cdot 20 = 60$ candidates for synergy vectors. These candidates can be interpreted as data-points in a 11 dimensional space. Afterwards the unsupervised learning method of vector quantization (k-means, MATLAB 2008b implementation) was applied to these data-points, in order to see whether 3 groups or clusters can be found which would correspond to 3 constantly detected synergies~\rref{sg:fig:images_nmf_expl_stab3}. In case of l stable groups a k-means clustering with l prototypes would therefore lead to a constant number of data-points assigned to each prototype and therefore the standard-deviation of data-points per cluster was chosen as a stability measurement for the NMF-algorithm. In all cases where NMF was applied in this study the standard-deviation has been found to be 0, indicating a very stable result of the chosen exploration method.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[height=3in]{images/nmf_expl_stab3.pdf}
	\caption{The stability of the used nmf exploration procedure was proofed by running the algorithm for 20 times repeatedly and afterwards grouping the resulting synergy vectors according to prototypes of a k-means clustering.

\subsection{Independent component analysis in the subspace of principal components (PCAICA)} % (fold)
\label{sg:sub:pcaica}

Although muscles in general do not posses \emph{negative activation}, during some movements they might be less active than their average activity during movement. Apart from NMF, the PCAICA algorithm is also capable of detecting and showing these inhibitory effects in muscle activation patterns.

First the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA), which can be described as a dimensionality reduction with the objective to lose as little information as possible. Therefore the data is transferred into a lower dimensional subspace whose orthogonal basis is oriented in the direction of the largest variance by minimizing the correlation of the data-points (muscle activation patterns). This basis is chosen in such a way that the first basis vector explains the largest possible part of the variance of the data, the second one explains the possible largest part of remaining variance, and so forth. \todo{can I assume this properties of pca as background of the reader?}

Afterwards the independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to this subspace in order to increase the statistical independence of the PCA basis vectors. Principle component analysis was applied to the data matrix $A$ by using the MATLAB function \emph{princomp} for which the number of variables corresponds to the number of muscles and the number of observations to the number of task conditions. This function also applies the required conversion to a zero-meaned distribution as it is required for PCA so it can directly be used with the same data as the NMF-algorithm. Subsequently the \emph{runica} function from the eeglab package~\cite{eeg} in its extended version was used on the scores of the first N selected eigenvectors. 
\todo{better explanation why we used ica}
This procedure generates components that may have negative values. However, since both PCA and ICA operate on signals with zero mean, a negative value for a given muscle can be interpreted as being activated less that its overall positive non-zero mean and can therefore reflect a inhibition of the muscle. The ICA section of the algorithm does not alter the reconstruction error that is determined by the eigenvalues of the first N selected principal components.

\subsection{Synergy comparison} % (fold)
\label{sg:sub:comp}
To compare two groups of synergies obtained by different methods, the vectors were
first normalized ( $\abss{x} = 1$ ) and then compared by using the correlation coefficient between them as a similarity measure. Comparison of two sets of synergies that were obtained by different algorithms, was realized by matching each vector of the first set against the vector most similar to it from the second set, in decreasing similarity order starting with the pair having maximal similarity. This method showed good results in terms of grouping similar synergies together, that could also be detected as very similar by visual inspection, although it does not give an objective and quantitative measure as the similarity measure is biased by the statistical properties (mostly non-negativity) of the synergy vectors. For quantitative analysis it is planned to make use of bootstrap methods as used in other studies~\cite{AdAvella:2005p2330}. Furthermore the correlation between two groups was computed on two vectors that contained all connected muscle activation patterns of a group.

\subsection{Model order selection/detection} % (fold)
\label{sg:sub:model_order}

Another reason to apply several algorithms in parallel is the difficulty to chose the correct dimensionality to which the data should be reduced, which is also known as the problem of model-order selection. As there is still no optimal solution for this decision Tresch et al proposed to compare results of different techniques. To asses the number of synergies the plot of reconstruction errors was used. In this plot of reconstruction error vs. number of used synergies the error decreases as more synergies are added. A marked slope change in this curve may point to the correct number of synergies, since adding more synergies does not significantly improve the reconstruction. Tresch et al developed an ad-hoc method for automatic detection of the change in slope, which gave good results in their work, where the decisive slope change could be estimated from the known true number of synergies. As a reliable parameter could not be found for the data of this work, the ad-hoc method was not used. Though an objective measure for model order selection could not be used, the chosen order seamed reasonable as a minimal number of synergies was selected, which on the one hand were able to explain a large part of the variability of the data while on the other hand still were small enough with respect to the amount of data that was available. Furthermore the previously mentioned paper of Tresch et al also showed that equal or similar synergies may also be found despite a wrong choice for the model order. Experiments took place within my study where data was reduced to both a higher number of synergies and also to a lower order model. The best synergies (with respect to most explained variance (NMF) or highest eigenvalues (PCA)) from the higher order model were compared to the synergies of the lower order model. These experiments came to the same results as in the publication of Tresch et al. \todo{some numbers to proof this}

\subsection{Muscle synergies in the space of preferred directions (PDs)} % (fold)
\label{sg:sub:pd}


For this analysis of muscle activation patterns and muscle synergies first a corresponding preferred direction for each muscle was computed. A simple vector summation approach was used which yielded nearly similar results than a cosine fit used by Georgopoulos et al~\cite{Georgopoulos:1982p4165} in a similar study. For every muscle an average activity rate was computed for movement in each of the 8 directions~\rref{sg:fig:images_cstd_pd}. This activity rates can be seen as 8 points in a polar coordinate system with $r$ being the mean activity rate and $\theta$ corresponding to the target direction. These vectors were translated into the cartesian coordinate system where the vector sum was computed in order to give a measure of the \emph{weighted mean direction}. When translated back into the polar coordinate system, the obtained $\theta$ will give the preferred direction and the length of $r$ can be used to assess the significance of the tuning to a preferred direction. The $r$ value was compared to tuning significance of random muscle activation patterns in a bootstrapping test and only PDs from sessions with significantly ($p < 0.05$) higher tuning than from random muscle activation were used furthermore.
\todo{check whether I really still do this (I mean the sorting out)}

As a measurement of \emph{directedness} of a certain muscle activation pattern, the circular standard deviation (\emph{cstd}) of PDs belonging to muscles activated within this pattern was computed. The \emph{cstd} for a given vector $\vec{x}$ of radians is defined by 
\begin{equation}
	\emph{cstd} := \sqrt{-2 \ln{\bar{R}}}
\end{equation}
where the mean resultant length $\bar{R}$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
	\bar{R} := \frac
					{ \sqrt{ {(\sum_{i}^n \cos  \vec{x}_i)}^2 + {(\sum_{i}^n \sin \vec{x}_i)}^2 }}
					{n}
\end{equation}
The \emph{cstd} was computed only on muscles of a synergy having an activation coefficient greater than the median of all muscle activation coefficients. This \emph{cstd} of a synergy was then compared
to a distribution of \emph{cstd}s from random samples of muscles drawn from a distribution with similar statistical properties to the synergies.

\subsection{Projection of evoked responses on natural synergies} % (fold)
\label{sg:sub:projection}

The question, whether the cortical stimulation induced responses are just arbitrary activations of muscles that contain some structure but are not related to natural activation patterns or whether they have something in common with the activation patterns that were found during natural movement is an interesting question. If this were the case, it would imply that the stimulation sites are in fact the sites where neuronal activation causes modular organized muscle response patterns, if these happen to be found during natural movement.

In order to find out whether the evoked responses tend to reside in the same subspace as spanned by the natural movement synergies, a measurement for subspace similarity had to be found. Tresch et al. used the principle angles between the two subspaces, spanned by synergies found in the evoked responses and during natural movement~\cite{Tresch:2006p3766}. Some experiments were done with this technique but I somehow never managed to get reliable and
comparable results from it and therefore another method was chosen.
\todo{cannot be written like this, also yifat offered and explanation why not using the principal angles!?}
The idea is to project the evoked responses to the subspace which is spanned by the natural synergies. When this transformation does not change the data, it already resides within this subspace. In more technical language, the data was orthogonally projected to an orthonormal basis constructed from the natural synergies and also to the orthogonal complement of this basis. How much the data tends to reside within one of the two subspaces is measured by the ratio between the sum of vector lengths (L2 norm) over all responses after projection to the two bases.

\begin{equation}
	ratio = \frac
		{\sum_{i} \abss{P(\vec{x}_{(i)})}} 
		{\sum_{i} \abss{P^{\perp}(\vec{x}_{(i)})}}
\end{equation}

As the chance to already reside within a m-dimensional subspace of an n-dimensional space highly depends on the ratio between $m$ and $n - m$ it was first tried to compare the ratio of the data to an expected ratio. If the entries in the natural movement synergy vectors would be drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean, the expected ratio would be exactly the ratio $\frac{m}{n - m}$. But when using the non-negative synergy vectors from natural movement this ratio becomes shifted. This is due to the Gram-Schmidt process which is used for the orthonormalization of the synergies. It always creates the first basis vector in the positive (hyper-)quadrant, which leads to an offset. As the main interest of the method was a qualitative answer, it was not further pursued to find an estimate for the offset from our data, but a bootstrap method was applied to find whether the data resides in the subspace of interest on a level above chance. Therefore the ratio computed for the data was compared to distributions of ratios, coming from 10000 runs of the projection on random data with the same statistical properties. As random data was used:

\begin{itemize}
	\item random data with same mean and std as original data
	\item random data with same mean and std within channels as in the original data
	\item shuffled versions of the original data
	\item within channel shuffled versions of the original data
\end{itemize}

\label{ap:sub:muscle_naming}

The abbreviations of the muscles are annotated by F for flexor, E for extensor and B for bi-directional. The numbers (e.g. ED45) mean that this muscle extends those fingers that are denoted by these numbers. Fingers are counted in a way that the thumb is finger 1.
